Taking that into account, your portfolio will need to generate approximately $51,000 - $72,000 per year to cover your expenses.

    "manager": "The historical data shows that a 50/50 portfolio has delivered an average annual return of around 6-7% over the past 20 years, with lower volatility than your current allocation.  We can achieve this shift by gradually selling some of your equity holdings and reinvesting in high-quality bonds.  I also want to explore some tax-efficient investment options, like municipal bonds, to minimize your tax burden in retirement.  Let me check current municipal bond yields for your tax bracket.",
